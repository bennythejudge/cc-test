# Puppet for the CC DevOps test

## The hiera will be stored with the puppet repo

## Passwords and other secrets will be stored in clear in the hiera to focus on the exercise

  - this is, obviously, unacceptable in a real world situation

## Time permitting, encryption via KMS will be added at the end

  - or, at least, generate passwords on the fly at `puppet apply` time
